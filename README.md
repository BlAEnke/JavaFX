# JavaFX
Created a database designed to store the data about students at a faculty and their projects.
The project was made using Microsoft Visual Studio Code as the IDE. The database was created using MySQL, consisting of a students table, a projects table and a table called Enrollments, which is the connection between those two.
This is a CRUD operations database!
As for the design, I used JavaFX framework to make the project responsive and the FXML files were designed in Scene Builder.
